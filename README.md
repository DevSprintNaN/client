#### CodeCrafters International Ltd. presents

## DevSprint 2024: Inter-University Software Developments Competition

### Theme: **Open-Source Project Hub for Collaborative Development Across Disciplines**

### Objective:

You need to develop a robust web platform that facilitates collaborative open-source development. The platform should provide essential features such as _project listing, skill-based matching, communication tools, data sharing, version control, reputation systems, educational resources, and impact tracking_.

 ### Problem Statement:

Develop an open-source project hub, serving as a central platform for collaboration on diverse open-source projects spanning fields such as engineering, science, design, education, and arts. The hub should be designed to accommodate contributors with varying skill sets and backgrounds, aiming to facilitate effective communication, streamlined collaboration, and cross-disciplinary innovation.

### Features:


1. **Multidisciplinary Project Listing:** Allow projects from diverse fields to be listed and categorized on the platform.
2. **Skill-Based Matching:** Implement a system that matches project requirements with contributor skills across different disciplines.
3. **Shared Workspace & Communication Tools:** Provide online collaboration tools such as code editors, whiteboards, and chat functionalities suitable for diverse project types.
4. **Data & Asset Sharing:** Enable secure sharing of various project assets including data, models, designs, and other relevant files across different disciplines.
5. **Version Control & Contribution Tracking:** Track changes and contributions seamlessly for different project types, including non-code-based projects.
6. **Reputation & Incentive System:** Build a robust system that recognizes contributions and incentivizes participation across various disciplines.
7. **Educational Resources & Mentorship:** Offer resources and mentorship programs to bridge knowledge gaps between disciplines and support continuous learning.
8. **Impact Tracking & Visualization:** Showcase the collective impact of open-source projects across diverse fields through visualization tools.

### Challenges:

- Designing intuitive user interfaces and functionalities that cater to the diverse needs of projects across various disciplines.
- Implementing secure and efficient data-sharing mechanisms to accommodate different file formats and project requirements.
- Developing a comprehensive reputation system that values contributions across non-traditional open-source disciplines.
- Fostering effective communication and collaboration among contributors with diverse skill sets and backgrounds.

### Additional Ideas:

- Integration with existing open-source platforms and tools relevant to different disciplines to enhance functionality and accessibility.
- Organization of virtual and in-person events to facilitate networking and collaboration among contributors from different disciplines.
- Partnership with research institutions, educational organizations, and industry players to promote cross-disciplinary open-source development and innovation.

### General Instructions:



- Create a new GitHub/Gitlab repository and try to do continuous development, rather than pushing all code at once. You will be judged based on the contribution of all the team members. 
    * If you want to keep your project private, you can inform us and we will provide you a profile that you need to add as a collaborator to the project.
    * If you want to create multiple repositories, then create an organization and put those repositories under the organization. At the time of submission, submit the orgnization URL.
- If you choose to use any publicly available code or any portion of it, remember to properly attribute the source.
- There is no restriction on which stack or tool you will use to develop the project.
- Proper instructions on how to use/run your project on our machines are highly recommended.
- At the time of submission, you will be asked to provide a source that is publicly usable and testable by any user. So make sure you have deployed all your source codes properly.
- The online development phase ends on **_February 16, 11:55 PM._** This is a hard deadline. We will provide you with a form beforehand where you can submit your projects and edit the submission within the timeline. But you wonâ€™t be able to submit or edit anything after the mentioned time and no changes in your code will be accepted after the mentioned time, even if the changes are documentation only.
- Make sure you have read the basic guidelines that had been sent to you over email for a better understanding of what you need to keep in mind during the development phase.
